This is an example Laravel project to demonstrate the TDD process for my presentation at the PHP Essex meetup group

Once installed, you can step through the development steps

```bash
$ git checkout step1
```

then 

```bash
$ git checkout step2
```

etc

On any step, run the tests with

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
